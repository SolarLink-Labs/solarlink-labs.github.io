        <h2>How to Contact Us</h2>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:slonsol.link@gmail.com">slonsol.link@gmail.com</a></p>

        <h2 id="notice-to-european-users">Notice to European Users</h2>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p><strong>Where This Notice to European Users Applies:</strong> The information provided in this “Notice to European Users” section applies only to individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK) (i.e., “Europe” as defined at the top of this Privacy Policy).</p>

        <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> References to “personal information” in this Privacy Policy should be understood to include a reference to “personal data” as defined in the “GDPR” (i.e., the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”)) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of the laws of the United Kingdom (“UK GDPR”). Under the GDPR, “personal data” means information about individuals from which they are either directly identified or can be identified. The personal information that we collect from and about you is described in greater detail in the section “Personal Information We Collect.”</p>

    
        <h3>Our Legal Bases for Processing</h3>
        <p>In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your personal information, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a “legal basis” for that use.</p>
        <p>Our legal bases for processing your personal information described in this Privacy Policy are listed below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> When we need to process your personal information in order to deliver the Service to you, or when you have asked us to take specific action which requires us to process your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> When it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with Law:</strong> When we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We have set out below the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant purposes for which we use your personal information – for more information on these purposes and the data types involved, see the <a href="#how-we-use-your-personal-information">How We Use Your Personal Information</a> section above and the description of associated data sharing relevant to such purposes set out in the <a href="#how-we-share-your-personal-information">How We Share Your Personal Information</a> section also above.</p>

        <h3>Retention</h3>
        <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for the <strong>Compliance and Protection</strong> purposes outlined above.</p>
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
        <p>When we no longer require the personal information that we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

        <h3>Other Information</h3>

        <h4>No Obligation to Provide Personal Information</h4>
        <p>You do not have to provide personal information to us. However, where we need to process your personal information either to comply with applicable law or to deliver our Service to you, and you fail to provide that personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide some or all of our Service to you. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

        <h4>No Sensitive Information</h4>
        <p>We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership, or biometric or genetic characteristics other than as requested by us as part of the Service) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any such sensitive personal information when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.</p>

        <h4>No Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h4>
        <p>As part of the Service, we do not engage in automated decision-making and/or profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects. We provide our analysis to our business customers, and our business customers make decisions that may affect you.</p>

        <h2>Your Additional Rights</h2>

            <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete your personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it—you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Transfer to you or a third party of your choice a machine-readable copy of your personal information which you have provided to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrict:</strong> Restrict the processing of your personal information, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Object:</strong> Object to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on Legitimate Interests—you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> When we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exercising These Rights</h3>
        <p>You may submit these requests by contacting us. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Whether or not we are required to fulfill any request you make will depend on a number of factors (e.g., why and how we are processing your personal information). If we reject any request you may make (whether in whole or in part), we will let you know our grounds for doing so at the time, subject to any legal restrictions. Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within a month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests; in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

        <h3>Your Right to Lodge a Complaint with Your Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>Although we urge you to contact us first to find a solution for any concern you may have, in addition to your rights outlined above, if you are not satisfied with our response to a request you make, or how we process your personal information, you can make a complaint to the data protection regulator in your habitual place of residence.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Users in the European Economic Area:</strong> The contact information for the data protection regulator in your place of residence can be found <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>For Users in the UK:</strong> The contact information for the UK data protection regulator can be found <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Processing Outside Europe</h3>
        <p>We are a U.S.-based company, and many of our service providers, advisers, partners, or other recipients of data are also based in the U.S. This means that if you use the Service, your personal information will necessarily be accessed and processed in the U.S. It may also be provided to recipients in other countries outside Europe.</p>

        <h4>When We Share Your Personal Information with Third Parties Outside Europe</h4>
        <p>We try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal information by making sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transfers to Territories with an Adequacy Decision:</strong> We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) or under specific adequacy frameworks approved by the European Commission or UK Government, such as the <strong>EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework</strong> or the <strong>UK Extension thereto</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfers to Territories without an Adequacy Decision:</strong> We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have not been deemed to provide such an adequate level of protection (e.g., the U.S.). However, in these cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>We may use <strong>specific appropriate safeguards</strong>, which are designed to give personal information effectively the same protection it has in Europe—for example, standard-form contracts approved by relevant authorities for this purpose; or</li>
                    <li>In limited circumstances, we may rely on an <strong>exception</strong> or ‘derogation’, which permits us to transfer your personal information to such a country despite the absence of an ‘adequacy decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’—for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of Europe.</p>
